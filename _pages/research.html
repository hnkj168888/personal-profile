        <h3>An Integrated Transportation Network Reliability Analysis Framework (一种综合交通网络可靠性分析框架)</h3>
        <p>A five-year research project funded by the prestigious Faculty Early Career Development Grant by the National Science Foundation (NSF) in the United States. This research synthesized various models, theories, and reliability measures into an integrated transportation network reliability analysis framework to improve understanding of the complex interactions between travelers and the transportation system.</p>
