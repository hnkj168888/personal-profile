      <h3>An Integrated Transportation Network Reliability Analysis Framework (一种综合交通网络可靠性分析框架)</h3>
      <p>A five-year research project funded by the prestigious Faculty Early Career Development Grant by the National Science Foundation (NSF) in the United States. This research synthesized various models, theories, and reliability measures into an integrated transportation network reliability analysis framework to improve understanding of the complex interactions between travelers and the transportation system.</p>

      <h3>Automated Generation of Concentric Circles Metro Maps Using Mixed-integer Optimization (使用混合整数规划自动生成同心圆地铁地图)</h3>
      <p>The concentric circles (CC) map design is an alternative approach for schematically representing metro systems. Compared with traditional octo-linear maps, CC maps can effectively simplify the perception of a network by visually accenting circular line patterns. This design offers new insights into the schematic drawing of metro systems that can improve map readability and engagement.</p>

    <h3>Path Flow Estimator with Applications (交通路径流量估计应用插件)</h3>
    <p>Visual PFE is an integrated software suite that combines the Path Flow Estimator (PFE) with other software components to facilitate the estimation, visualization, and refinement of estimates with a user-friendly graphical user interface. Visual PFE has been developed for different transportation planning applications, including origin-destination (O-D) estimation, planning for small communities with limited resources, and bicycle planning.</p>

    <h3>3D GIS, Land-Use Planning Scenarios, and Transport Models for Urban Simulation (城市仿真三维地理信息系统、土地使用规划方案及交通模型)</h3>
    <p>This project centers on enhancing 3D land use data within collaborative urban simulation. It aims to create a unified 3D geospatial platform encompassing multimodal transportation networks, geospatial data, and 3D visualization. Additionally, the project examines urban form and livability, focusing on transit-oriented development (TOD) areas. It also assesses 3D walking accessibility in public open spaces and explores traffic management using deep reinforcement learning.</p>
